## statement of problem
Returns the Boolean value of the statement “the maze is navigable, having a legal
travel path that is continuous from start point to existing treasure”
Navigate a maze form start to finish
### legal means:
> don’t cross the walls

> right-angle turns only

> a path cannot go through the same point twice

## recursive absraction
When I am asked to solve a maze from start point to end point the recursive abstraction can
solve the maze from a point next to the start to the end point

## base case
The start point is directly adjacent to the end point
## English or pseudocode description of algorith
If 
  the start point is directly adjacent to the end point
then
  ??
Else if
  the start point is directly adjacent to a dead end
then 
  ??
Else
  Solve the maze from a point next to the start to the end point
